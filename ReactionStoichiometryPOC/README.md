## Proof-of-concept script
This is what I used in 2021 to test some ideas.

Make sure you have [numpy](https://numpy.org/) and [sympy](https://sympy.org/).

I usually do `python tests_auto.py > lastrun.txt`

Check `tests_auto.py` script for interactive mode flag

<b>Limitations:</b> it uses floating-point numbers, has no notation for ion charges, and generally is to be considered fast-and-dirty thing
