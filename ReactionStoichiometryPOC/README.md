## Proof-of-concept script
This is what I created in 2021 to test the idea from Mr R's paper

Make sure you have [numpy](https://numpy.org/) and [sympy](https://www.sympy.org/).

I usually do `python tests_auto.py > lastrun.txt`

Check that `tests_auto.py` for interactive mode flag to enter eqs manually
